In 2004, Bengaluru's Linux User Group(LUG) unfortunaly stopped meeting and died. We're bringing it back.

So why should you join?

- Monthly meetings where you can meet like minded people
- Forums where you can interact with others
- Mailing lists!
- A minor cult?(this is a joke)

Jokes aside we want to create a space of like minded people, and help promote [Free and Open-Source Software(FOSS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software). We love FOSS and want to help create a space the FOSS comunitee of Bengaluru can meet. While this is called a Linux Users Group we want to promote all FOSS software not just Linux. This is our plan for the LUG going forward in the short term.

- Soft launch at [FOSS India](https://fossunited.org/indiafoss/2025)
- First Online meeting, tentatively in October
- First election and formation of a executive comitee tentatively in November
- A in person meetup and official full launch of the LUG also possibly in November or December


If you're intersted in meeting a group of like minded people, who love FOSS please reach out to us at [todo add email/form]
