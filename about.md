## Nullrequest

I'm basically the guy who thought about restarting the Linux User Group. I currently work at [SUSE](https://suse.com) (the company who's linux distro is the base for OpenSuse). I came up with the idea for this after learning about the [Edmonton Linux User Group](https://elug.ca). I knew there used to be a LUG in Banglore, So I thought to myself "why not bring it back so I can meet like minded people". Keys comes in here. I messaged him and well bing bang boom one domain purchase later we're restarting the linux user group!

## Keys

Hi everyone,
I’m Rishi! I’m an open-source enthusiast and contributor to projects like KDE and Nix. I love tinkering with computers, learning new things, and sharing ideas. Excited to be part of this LUG and looking forward to meeting fellow nerds and exchanging cool stuff!
